Hello!

Welcome to my first Portfolio also known as T1A2 - Portfolio Assignment.

A link (URL) to your published portfolio website:

EdStem was used to supply Web Previews:

VSCode Live server was used as well:

Link to the GitHub repo:

	git@github.com:breeeeezy/Portfolio.git

Purpose-

	This portfolio was aimed to display my HTML and CSS skills, gain experience with devoloping a project as well as learning to advertise myself.

Functionality/ features-

	Components that are applied/implemented:

		Buttons
		CSS Grid
		FlexBox
		Animations/keyframes
		Screen Sizing
		Header/Footer
		Dropdown Menu

	The site is designed to supply the information needed in an efficient and simplistic way. The homepage for example has large icons that link to
	the entire site, allowing for ease of traversal as well as supplying a high revisit value for links such as Github and Linkedin.

	The site was constructed in a way so most of the default settings for a webpage is made in the stylesheet so whenever new pages are to be developed,
	components can be brought from the stylesheet with ease and construction offering quick page construction.

	The pages have effects and transitions giving a sort of interactivity for the user that engages them. Of course is fast enough so it doesn't
	get in the users way.

	Furthur development needed for formatting and layout modifications to allow for a smoother experience.

	Planned Dropdown menu for mobile view are in a work in progress state.

	Footer Properties are to be modified when layout of page meets requirements.
